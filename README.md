# advent-of-code

My solutions for Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) editions 2018 through 2021. Solutions are mainly in Python and Go, some other languages may be added in the future as well.

As can be noticed, I usually just solve the first few days.

**DISCLAIMER**: These solutions were created to be functional and not always reflect best code practices (neither are they necessarily the most optimized solutions).

## Tests

To run the tests, simply run `pytest` in the root directory (requires the Pytest package).

## Run

To run any single solution, execute it from the root directory. For example: `python3 2021/python/day1.py`
